                    <hr>
                    <p>Record a 60s voice memo of one of your ROL stories. Your story can take many, many forms, for instance:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A letter to your ancestor</li>
                        <li>A letter to the invisible force</li>
                        <li>A story of an ancestor you look up to</li>
                        <li>A force that has trickled through the generations and had an effect on you (e.g. ancestral trauma, family legends, the impact on one event of others)</li>
                    </ul>
